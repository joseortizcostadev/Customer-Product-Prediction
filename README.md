## What is CPP?

Customer Product Predictor (CPP) is a set of modules designed to allow you to run prediction features on your Drupal site in order to predict the probability of a customer buying your products based on the latest artificial intelligence algorithms and tools. Development has been driven by two major emphases: flexibility and usability. So far, we have launch the core module of this product which is fully functional and independent of future releases related to this product. Also, we have launch the module CPP Ubercart which automatically evaluate order comments made when your customers buy a product using the ubercart module. CPP Module provide custom hooks that are fired when a automatic evaluation of your order is made. That's it, we are building a scalable and flexible system which administrative interface, particularly relating to the configuration of your data and its related permissions has been designed for ease of use and efficient display of information.
